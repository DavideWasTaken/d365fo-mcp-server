/**
 * Indexed-object XML lookup.
 *
 * Shared fallback path for the get_object_info readers: when the C# bridge returns
 * no data (bridge not connected, running without metadata access, or its DiskProvider
 * simply does not cover that package), the symbol index usually still knows the object
 * — `search` finds it. Reporting "not found" in that situation is wrong and has burned
 * agents repeatedly (see eval corpus: EDT "Bridge returned no data" while the same EDTs
 * resolved through search / validate_code).
 *
 * This module resolves an indexed object to a readable local XML string:
 *   1. symbol index row (case-insensitive, index-safe via lookupSymbolNocase)
 *   2. the indexed file path if it exists on this machine
 *   3. the same path remapped onto the configured packages root (the DB may store
 *      Azure DevOps build-agent paths)
 *   4. extracted-metadata JSON files, which wrap the XML in a `raw` property

 *
 * Called only once no file was found at the recorded path or its local remap.
 * Whether that absence means "deleted" depends on where the index was built:
 *
 * - BUILT HERE — the recorded path's metadata root (the folder holding the package
 *   folders: a PackagesLocalDirectory, a UDE custom root, a repo) exists on this
 *   machine and holds packages. The indexer read the file from there, so it was
 *   deleted: a rolled-back object, a removed model, a whole package dropped by a
 *   branch switch, a dangling model symlink.
 * - BUILT ELSEWHERE — a CI agent (`/home/vsts/...`, `C:\home\vsts\...`) or an old
 *   UDE version folder. The shipped index records those for every standard object,
 *   so absence proves nothing by itself; only the object's own (Ax<Type>) or model
 *   folder being present at the recorded path or the local remap does. A missing
 *   package there is "not installed" as often as "deleted", and calling every such
 *   row a ghost made the bridge-less reader answer "not found" for CustTable.
 * - Package-relative rows (`Pkg/Model/AxTable/X.xml`) name no root; they get the
 *   lenient test against each local metadata root.
 * - An unreachable or unconfigured packages root makes no folder visible, so it
 *   can never turn every row into a ghost on a bad config day.
 * - A path to the extracted-metadata JSON cache is not the AOT source and proves
 *   nothing either way (see isAotSourcePath).
