      'One capture at a time. start → reproduce the scenario → stop → analyze. The capture also stops by itself after seconds (default 60, limit from setup) or when the file reaches the size limit.',
      'mode=auto: you reproduce the scenario yourself right after start, through a browser tool you have (Claude in Chrome, Codex browser) or by running the job; keep the window short and stop as soon as it is done.',
      'mode=manual: tell the user that the capture is running and exactly what to do in the D365FO client, wait for them to say they are done, then call stop. Do not stop before they confirm, unless the capture already ended.',
      'Warm up first: run the scenario once untraced, so the capture measures the code and not the first-run caching. For a long job capture a representative window (30–120 s) mid-run, not the whole job.',
      'start refuses with TRACE_LOCATION_NEEDED when no folder is set or the folder lacks space. Show the user the drives it lists, ask which folder to use, then call start again with outputDir; the folder is remembered for this installation unless rememberOutputDir=false. A configured trace.outputDir cannot be overridden, and a drive root is refused. analyze (with file) and delete accept only captures inside the trace folder.',
      'analyze runs in its own process and can take minutes on a large capture (about 15,000 events/s). It answers within waitSeconds (default 25) with the result, or with progress: call analyze again with the same arguments until it returns the result. Do not start other analyses meanwhile.',
      'focus selects the threads to analyse by method-name substring (e.g. the batch task class); pid restricts to one process. scope=subtree counts only time below the focus method. Without focus every thread is analysed, which mixes in background activity. The dialog or controller of a batch job runs in the web process and only schedules tasks; the work runs in Batch.exe: focus on the task class and pass the pid of Batch.exe (threads[] shows the pid and roots of each thread).',
      'Reading the result: exclusive = time in the method itself, inclusive = including callees, sqlInclusive = SQL time beneath it. sqlShareOfTime is over busySeconds, the time the selected threads spent working (idle gaps between calls excluded). topSqlByCount and repeatedSql reveal per-record queries in loops (one caller running the same statement thousands of times).',
      'Accuracy: ETW adds a cost to every method event, so small, frequently called methods look slower than they are; rank and compare, do not quote the seconds as the real run time. Read caveats before concluding. openAtEnd frames had not returned when the capture stopped; their time is a lower bound.',
      'A capture holds customer data: SQL parameter values and user names are in the .etl file. The tool never returns parameter values. Keep captures on the VM, never copy them elsewhere, and delete them (action=delete) once the analysis is done or when the user asks.',
